# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project II

### Description
In this project, I will investigate data related to bike share systems in three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I'll develop a Python script to import the data and answer intriguing questions about it by producing b>descriptive statistics/b>. In addition, I will construct a script that will take raw information and generate an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
### Files used
The datasets provided by udacity, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

- Start Time 
- End Time 
- Trip Duration 
- Start Station 
- End Station 
- User Type 

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year


## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, i will use:

- Python 
- A text editor
- A terminal application





## The Interactive Experience
For a more interactive experience, I wrote a script that took raw input from the user and proccess the data into an output based on the request.
